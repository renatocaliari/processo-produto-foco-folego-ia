# Chapter 6: `FolegoSection` Component

In the [previous chapter](05_filtering_logic_.md), we saw how filtering helps us focus on specific parts of the main product development process, which is displayed using components like [`ProcessSection`](02__processsection__component_.md) and [`StageCard`](03__stagecard__component_.md). But product development isn't just about the core tasks; it's also about maintaining energy, learning, and improving the process itself.

Imagine the main product process as a busy assembly line ("Foco" - Focus). Sometimes, you need a separate space off to the side ‚Äì maybe a workshop, a library, or a break room ‚Äì for activities that support the main work but aren't directly part of building the *current* product feature. This could be for team meetings, learning new skills, or experimental side projects. How do we represent this "breather" or "stamina" space ("F√¥lego") in our visual map?

That's the job of the `FolegoSection` component!

## Meet the Side Area

The `FolegoSection` component is designed specifically to display the "F√¥lego" activities ‚Äì things that help the team maintain pace and quality over the long run. Think of it as a **dedicated side panel** or **companion section** that sits alongside the main "Foco" production line.

Key characteristics:

1.  **Separate Activities:** It displays a list of activities (like "Retrospectivas", "Aprendizado Cont√≠nuo") that are distinct from the core product stages shown in `ProcessSection`.
2.  **Simpler Content:** It typically just shows a list of items, not detailed `StageCard`s with responsibles, comments, and resources. The data comes from `data/folego.data.ts` (covered in [Chapter 4: Product Process Data Structure](04_product_process_data_structure_.md)).
3.  **Unique Collapsible Design:** This is its most special feature!
    *   Like `ProcessSection`, it can be expanded or collapsed.
    *   **On larger screens (desktops):** When *collapsed*, it shrinks down into a very narrow vertical bar, showing just an icon and the rotated title ("f√¥lego"). When *expanded*, it takes up a moderate amount of width (like 1/5th of the available space) to show the list of activities. This makes it feel like a retractable sidebar.
    *   **On smaller screens (mobile):** It behaves more like a standard collapsible section, stacking vertically with other content.

## How `ProductProcess` Uses `FolegoSection`

The main page component, [`ProductProcess`](01_main_page___productprocess___.md), is responsible for placing the `FolegoSection` alongside the main process sections and managing its expanded/collapsed state.

Let's look at the simplified code in `app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// File: app/page.tsx (Simplified)
// ... imports and other state ...
import { FolegoSection } from "@/components/folego-section";
import { processData } from "@/data";

export default function ProductProcess() {
  // State to track if Folego is expanded (managed by ProductProcess)
  const [isFolegoExpanded, setIsFolegoExpanded] = useState(false);
  // ... other state like expandedSections, activeFilter ...

  return (
    <div /* ... page layout ... */ >
      {/* ... title, filters, etc. ... */}

      {/* Main layout: Foco sections on left, Folego on right (on large screens) */}
      <div className="flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-4 mb-8">
        {/* Container for the main 'Foco' sections */}
        <div /* ... focus section container ... */ >
          {/* ... ProcessSections for Compreens√£o, Defini√ß√£o, Implementa√ß√£o ... */}
        </div>

        {/* Render the Folego Section */}
        <FolegoSection
          data={processData.folego} // Pass the specific 'folego' data
          isExpanded={isFolegoExpanded} // Tell it whether to be expanded
          onToggle={() => setIsFolegoExpanded(!isFolegoExpanded)} // Give it the function to call when clicked
          emoji="üßò" // Pass an emoji for the header
        />
      </div>
      {/* ... other components ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **State:** `ProductProcess` uses `useState` to create `isFolegoExpanded` (which is `true` or `false`) and `setIsFolegoExpanded` (the function to change it).
2.  **Layout:** The `lg:flex-row` class arranges the "Foco" container and the `FolegoSection` side-by-side on large screens (`lg` breakpoint and up). On smaller screens, they stack (`flex-col`).
3.  **Rendering:** `ProductProcess` renders `<FolegoSection />` and passes it the necessary props:
    *   `data`: The specific part of `processData` related to F√¥lego activities.
    *   `isExpanded`: The current value of the `isFolegoExpanded` state.
    *   `onToggle`: A simple function that calls `setIsFolegoExpanded` to flip the state between `true` and `false`.
    *   `emoji`: An optional emoji for the header.

## Inside `FolegoSection`: How it Works

Let's trace what the `FolegoSection` component (in `components/folego-section.tsx`) does.

**Scenario:** User clicks the F√¥lego header.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant FolegoSection as F√¥lego Section
    participant ProductProcess as Main Page

    User->>FolegoSection as F√¥lego Section: Clicks header button
    Note over FolegoSection as F√¥lego Section: Calls the 'onToggle' function received as a prop
    FolegoSection as F√¥lego Section->>ProductProcess as Main Page: Calls setIsFolegoExpanded(!isFolegoExpanded)
    Note over ProductProcess as Main Page: Updates 'isFolegoExpanded' state (flips true/false)
    ProductProcess as Main Page->>ProductProcess as Main Page: Re-renders because state changed
    ProductProcess as Main Page->>FolegoSection as F√¥lego Section: Re-renders, passing new 'isExpanded' prop value
    Note over FolegoSection as F√¥lego Section: Adjusts width and content visibility based on new 'isExpanded' value
```

**Step-by-step:**

1.  **Receive Props:** The component gets `data`, `isExpanded`, `onToggle`, and `emoji` from `ProductProcess`.
2.  **Check Screen Size:** It uses a helper (like the `useIsMobile` hook seen in the code) to determine if the screen is considered "mobile" or "large". This helps decide *how* to display the collapsed state.
3.  **Render Container:** It renders the main `div` that holds everything. Critically, it applies conditional CSS classes for the width, based on the `isExpanded` prop and screen size. For example:
    *   If `isExpanded` is `true`, it might get `lg:w-1/5` (take 1/5th width on large screens).
    *   If `isExpanded` is `false`, it might get `lg:w-16` (take a fixed, narrow width of 16 units on large screens).
4.  **Render Header Button:** It renders a `<button>` that acts as the header.
    *   The `onClick` handler is set to the `onToggle` function received from `ProductProcess`.
    *   **Special Collapsed View (Large Screens):** If `isExpanded` is `false` AND the screen is large (`!isMobile`), it displays the content differently: the emoji and title ("f√¥lego") are rotated 90 degrees and centered in the narrow bar.
    *   **Normal View (Expanded or Mobile):** Otherwise, it displays the emoji, title, and a chevron icon normally.
5.  **Render Content:** It uses `{isExpanded && (...) }` to conditionally render the content *only* if `isExpanded` is `true`. The content includes:
    *   The `data.description` (if provided).
    *   An unordered list (`<ul>`) where it loops through the `data.content` array (which contains strings like "Retrospectiva do time/processo") and renders each string as a list item (`<li>`).

## A Peek at the `FolegoSection` Code

Here's a simplified look inside `components/folego-section.tsx`:

```typescript
// File: components/folego-section.tsx (Simplified)
"use client"

import { ChevronDown, ChevronRight } from "lucide-react";
import { useIsMobile } from "@/hooks/use-mobile"; // Helper to check screen size

// Define the expected props
interface FolegoSectionProps {
  data: any; // Contains { title, description, content: [...] }
  emoji?: string;
  isExpanded: boolean; // Current expansion state
  onToggle: () => void; // Function to call when clicked
}

export function FolegoSection({ data, emoji, isExpanded, onToggle }: FolegoSectionProps) {
  const isMobile = useIsMobile(); // Check if we're on a small screen

  return (
    // Main container: width changes based on isExpanded and screen size (lg)
    <div
      className={`
        border-4 border-black rounded-xl bg-white ...
        transition-all duration-300 flex flex-col // Animate width change
        ${isExpanded ? "lg:w-1/5" : "lg:w-16"} // <-- Key width change for large screens
      `}
    >
      {/* Clickable Header Button */}
      <button
        onClick={onToggle} // Call parent's toggle function
        className={`
          w-full font-bold text-xl flex items-center justify-between p-4
          ${isExpanded ? "border-b-2 border-black" : "h-full"} // Style changes
          hover:bg-gray-100 relative // Make position relative for absolute child
        `}
      >
        {/* Special Collapsed View for Large Screens */}
        {!isExpanded && !isMobile ? (
          <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center">
            <div className="transform rotate-90 flex flex-row text-center"> {/* Rotate text */}
              <ChevronDown size={20} /> { /* Icon (could adjust based on state) */ }
              {emoji && <span /* ... */ >{emoji}</span>}
              f√¥lego {/* Rotated title */}
            </div>
          </div>
        ) : (
          /* Normal Expanded or Mobile View */
          <>
            <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
              {emoji && <span /* ... */ >{emoji}</span>}
              <span>f√¥lego</span> {/* Normal title */}
            </div>
            {/* Chevron icon changes direction */}
            {isExpanded ? <ChevronRight className="rotate-180" size={20} /> : <ChevronDown size={20} />}
          </>
        )}
      </button>

      {/* Content Area: Only rendered if isExpanded is true */}
      {isExpanded && (
        <>
          {/* Optional Description */}
          {data.description && (
            <div className="p-4 text-sm border-b-2 border-black">
              <p>{data.description}</p>
            </div>
          )}

          {/* List of Folego Activities */}
          <div className="p-4 flex-grow overflow-y-auto">
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
              {/* Loop through the content array from data */}
              {data.content.map((item: string, index: number) => (
                <li key={index} className="text-sm">
                  {item} {/* Display each activity string */}
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
          </div>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key Code Points:**

*   **Conditional Width:** The `${isExpanded ? "lg:w-1/5" : "lg:w-16"}` part in the main `div`'s `className` uses Tailwind CSS classes to dynamically change the width on large (`lg`) screens based on the `isExpanded` prop. The `transition-all` class makes this change smooth.
*   **Conditional Header:** The `{!isExpanded && !isMobile ? (...) : (...) }` block checks if the section is collapsed *and* if it's not a mobile screen. If both are true, it renders the special rotated view; otherwise, it renders the standard header.
*   **Conditional Content:** The `{isExpanded && (...) }` block ensures the description and the list of activities are only rendered when the section is expanded.
*   **Data Mapping:** `data.content.map(...)` iterates over the simple array of strings provided in `data.content` and creates a list item (`<li>`) for each one.

## Conclusion

The `FolegoSection` component provides a dedicated space in the UI for auxiliary "F√¥lego" activities, keeping them visually distinct from the main "Foco" process flow. Its most notable feature is the unique collapsing behavior on large screens, where it transforms into a narrow, icon-based sidebar, offering an elegant way to tuck away secondary information while keeping it accessible. It uses state managed by the parent [`ProductProcess`](01_main_page___productprocess___.md) component and displays simpler list-based data from `data/folego.data.ts`.

Now that we've seen the main process sections (`ProcessSection`), the side activities section (`FolegoSection`), and how filtering works, let's look at a specialized section used within the main flow: the [Chapter 7: `ImplementationSection` Component](07__implementationsection__component_.md), which has its own internal structure for handling Discovery and Delivery tracks.
